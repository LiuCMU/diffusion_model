Diffusion models (Sohl-Dickstein, et al. 2015) are a relative new area of research in ML. They are a type of generative models. They can generate new data after learning the underlying diffusion process of the training dataset. 
They are typically trained on a large dataset. The models use density funtions (for example Gaussian) to desceribe the distribution of data. The parameters are optmized through MLE or gradient-based methods. Diffusion models have many potential applications, including image and audio synthesis, anormal data detection(https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04758), data augmentation, targeted molecule generation, etc.
